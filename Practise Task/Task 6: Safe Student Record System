'''Task: Safe Student Record System
Build a program that:
Stores 3 students
For each student:
name (string)
age (integer ≥ 0) → validated
cgpa (0 to 10) → validated
Uses:
list of dictionaries
while loops
try/except
Prints all students nicely at end'''
try:
    students = []
    for i in range (3):
        name = input(f"Enter name {i+1}: ")
        age = int(input(f"Enter age {i+1}: "))
        cgpa = float(input(f"Enter CGPA {i+1}: "))
        student = {"name" : name,
                "age" : age,
                "cgpa" : cgpa
            }
        students.append(student)
        continue
        break

    print("Please enter a valid number")
